Hello, I’m Senior Investigation Officer Lim from the Anti-Scam Centre.
I understand this is unexpected, but your cooperation is essential.
We are investigating an organised fraud ring operating out of Singapore.
Did you receive any strange links via SMS or WhatsApp recently?
Even if you did not click them, your device could still be compromised.
Please ensure your camera is enabled during this verification process.
You may not close any background apps until we complete this.
The M A S has authorised this call under emergency protocol 2 0 2 3.
To continue, you must verbally agree to temporary asset isolation.
Please state “I agree” to begin the protected transfer process.

For security, your phone must remain in airplane mode during the transfer.
You may not speak to bank personnel while this process is ongoing.
Have you travelled outside of Singapore in the past 30 days?
There was an attempt to register a company using your name and NRIC.
This may be an attempt to commit business fraud in your name.
You must assist us to protect your legal identity from misuse.
Please install the S A F E app from the link we will send you — it is not in the App Store.
This is a confidential digital lock — not for public use.
Any failure to follow the steps may result in automatic account freezing.
The system has matched your IC to a flagged foreign IP from Thailand.

You are not in any danger if you follow the guidelines strictly.
We will give you a safe account to deposit all available funds first.
Once the screening is complete, everything will be returned back to your original account.
If you delay this process, there may be long-term financial consequences.
I understand this sounds serious, but we are on your side.
You are not under arrest. This is a preventive measure to protect you.
The recording will be used to verify your cooperation with the authorities.
To confirm, are you now ready to proceed with the security transfer?
Please prepare a pen and paper to write down your reference ID.
We will now connect you to the next officer in charge of this case.

Your mobile number was used to register a GrabPay wallet with fraudulent activity.
Have you ever shared your phone number on public websites or forums?
The scam ring we are investigating is believed to be operating within Southeast Asia.
Our records show a mismatch between your H D B address and registered mailing address.
This type of case falls under Financial Code Red — we must act fast.
Please do not restart your phone during this process as it may trigger a security lockout.
There is a 2-minute window for you to complete the next instruction.
Are you now on your online banking homepage? Let me guide you step-by-step.
You will not be charged for this process — it is part of an investigation.
We may need to take a screen recording of your banking app for verification.

You are currently protected under the Interim Scam Shield Protocol.
If we detect any non-compliance, the case will be escalated immediately.
Can you confirm if your device is an iPhone or Android?
Please disable your biometric login for now to prevent interception.
You should not switch tabs or use messaging apps while on this call.
Your security clearance must be completed within the next 15 minutes.
We are assigning you a one-time-use account to store your emergency funds.
This account is managed under the S G Secure Digital Authority.
All actions on your account are being logged by the cyber task force.
Your financial report will be sent to your SingPass inbox after review.

There may be a follow-up call from the Central Investigation Bureau tomorrow.
Until this matter is closed, please avoid using public Wi-Fi or unverified apps.
You are advised to keep your location services turned on during this period.
All your transactions will be matched against the government’s secure record.
This is not a prank. We are giving you a final chance to resolve this privately.
You must keep your phone line open until you receive the final clearance.
Once the verification team is satisfied, you will receive a formal clearance SMS.
Please remain patient. We are here to assist you, not to accuse you.
As long as you follow our instructions, your name will be cleared.
This concludes the current part of your verification. Do not exit the call until we say so.
